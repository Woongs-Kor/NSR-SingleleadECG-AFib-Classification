# Processing Folder

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing ECG (electrocardiogram) data.

- `ECG_SignalSplit.ipynb`: Splits raw ECG signals into fixed-length sequences for consistent analysis.
- `ECG_Signalpreprocessing.ipynb`: Applies filtering techniques to remove noise from ECG signals.

## Usage

1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter.
2. Modify file paths and parameters as needed.
3. Run cells to preprocess and clean ECG data.

These scripts prepare ECG data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
